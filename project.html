                One of my favorite projects is my Harry Potter name generator I coded in Python.
                It's not the most complex program ever, but I had fun making it and I like making my coworkers use it.
                Whenever someone new in my department at work starts, I have them try it out.
                The reason why I made it was we were waiting for inventory counts to finish at work one day
                 and had some free time to do something fun.

                It was the first program I worte that used a GUI and played music while you used it. 
                Like any programmer, I googled a lot of new stuff and used Pygame to get the music to play.
                I had never made a GUI either so I looked up how to make a GUI and used Tkinter for it. 
                I get a kick out of people using it and asking why it says things like, "Hairy Potter" and "Lavate los manos."

                The project was a success. I completed what I set out to do and learned some new skills.

                Maybe one day I'll convert the program into a functioning webpage.ðŸ˜‰
