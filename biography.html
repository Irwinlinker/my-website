            <h2>Living along the <em>Guadalupe River</em>.</h2>
            <p>For 2 years we lived 100 feet from the rivers edge. 
              Every day I'd come home and go play along the bank or go fishing.</p>
            <p>During the summer my friends and I would go swimming in the river often. 
              The low hanging oak trees were perfect to climb on and jump off into the water.</p>

            <h2>I work at a company called ThermoFisher Scientific.</h2>
            <p>I am a <strong>Senior Manufacturing Technician</strong> there. I've worked there for almost 2 years now.</p>  
            <p>I started my academic studies at Aims with a heading towards IT things, but once I started my programming classes I realized I liked that more than IT stuff so I made that my focus.</p>

        <div>
            <h2><span class="fav-color">Green</span> is my favorite color.</h2>
            <p>Not too sure why I like it so much. For as long as I can remember it has just been my favorite color.</p>
