            <p>My favorite hobby is to make all things. 
                I heard the term when I worked at a company called Aleph Objects and we manufactured 3D printers. 
                We just started an internal campaign called "Make All Things" and I liked it a whole lot! 
                I learned so many skills and I realized that I just like to make all things. 
                By just making all sorts of things I learned new skills from 3D modeling to video editing, programming and what ever I needed the skills for to do something. </p>

            <h2>Linker Lures</h2>
            <p>Something I did in 2019 after Aleph Objects went out of business and I lost my job was I worked on a YouTube channel of my own called Linker Lures. 
                I designed my own fishing lures and 3D printed them. 
                I tried them out and I wasn't too successful at catching fish with them but I had fun. 
                I used skills I had to make the 3D model in a program called <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank" title="Go to the Blender website">Blender</a>. 
                Then I learned some video editing skills and edited the video in Blender also. 
                Here are my videos I posted to YouTube before I became too busy with school and other things and gave up on that project.</p>
